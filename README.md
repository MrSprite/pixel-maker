Installation

Click the Download ZIP button that is located on the right.  Extract the PixelMaker.py file from the archive.
Import into Blender just like you would a normal Addon.

Select an image to use with the script.  
I recommend an image less than 100x100, because with 10,000 objects, Blender gets sluggish and my script starts to slow down because of that.
If the chosen image has transparency, any of the pixels that are even slightly transparent will not become a cube.

Play around with the options:
1) Object:
This option lets you choose different objects to add instead of a basic cube.

2) Height Mapping:
Check the box to enable this option.
Once it is, you can change the number to influence the z-scale of the created object based on the pixel brightness.

3) Join Cubes:
This joins the cubes upon completion into one single object.

4) Height Variation:
This randomizes the height of each object.

Then click run!
